# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How To Install

In the project directory, you can run:

1.

### npm install

This will install all dependecies and packages

2.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Testing Purpose and Deploying

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## Learn More

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Assumption While Coding

The project can be improved by fetching an API (Application Programming Interface) from the backed using any library of interest(Axios). E.g let's say a dog breed api, we get the value input into the text-field, and search for that type of dog breed and retun back the picture of the Dog.

giving back an Error message if dog's breed does not exist.
